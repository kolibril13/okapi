Blender for scientific animation
This course is an introduction to the software Blender. Blender is a general purpose 3D animation software used mostly for art, object mesh generation etc. However there is a growing community using Blender to create scientific visualizations and animations. This course will cover both an introduction to the software and an introduction to scientific extensions:
Day 1: Blender basics: materials, shading, node systems, asset management, and animation with keyframes.
Day 2: Geometry Nodes: object manipulation, simulation zones (e.g. wavefront animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sVu0qpeUyg ), and project-based learning (e.g. Brownian motion with Molecular Nodes, microscopy nodes with a simple stack). Simple data pipeline project via notebook. E.g. Python simulation of Black Body radiation connected to Blender.
Course Objectives
Become familiar with the Blender interface
Learn how to use scientific extensions to create renderings and animations
Learn how to interface Blender with interactive computing (Jupyter)
