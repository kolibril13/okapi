# Blender for Scientific Animation

This course is an introduction to the software Blender. Blender is a general purpose 3D animation tool, mostly used in art and for object mesh generation. However there is a growing community using Blender to create scientific visualizations and animations.

The course covers both a general introduction to Blender and an introduction to scientific extensions.
