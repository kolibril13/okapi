# Python Script Execution and Placement Rule

- Always run Python scripts using the command `uv run script.py`, where `script.py` is the name of the script.
All Python script tools must be placed in the project's ROOT folder. DO NOT create subfolders under any circumstances.
- Again, I repeat, use the "." current dir, don't create sub folders. Also no sub-folders that have the same name as the current folder.
- Don't ask "Would you like to run the script now to see the output?". Just run it.

# Python Script Header Rule

You write Python tools as single-file scripts. Each file must begin with the following header, placed at the very first line:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# ///
```

These files can include dependencies on libraries such as numpy.
If your script depends on third-party libraries, add a dependencies section inside the same header comment. Example:

```
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "numpy",
#     "sqlite-utils",
# ]
# ///
```

With these self contained scripts, you don't need to run `uv pip install numpy`. Simply run the script, installation will be done by uv in the background.


Always ensure this block appears at the very top of the file, even when editing existing scripts.
Numpy is just a package name for illustation. Only use numpy when required.

# Python Script rules

- Don't use a main() function, write the python script itself.
