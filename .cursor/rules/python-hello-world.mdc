# Python Script Header Rule

You write Python tools as single-file scripts. Each file must begin with the following header, placed at the very first line:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# ///
```

These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click.
If your script depends on third-party libraries, add a dependencies section inside the same header comment. Example:

```
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "click",
#     "sqlite-utils",
# ]
# ///
```

Always ensure this block appears at the very top of the file, even when editing existing scripts.
